## Effortless Flutter Feature Scaffolding with Clean Architecture

Arch Wizard is a powerful, flexible **command-line tool** designed to **automate the creation of entire feature modules** for Flutter apps ‚Äî structured according to clean architecture principles.
Save time, reduce boilerplate, and maintain consistency across your projects and teams.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Full Feature Scaffolding:** Generate complete feature folders with domain, data, and presentation layers in a single command.
* **Clean Architecture Enforced:** Clear separation between layers, making your app scalable and maintainable.
* **Multi-State Management Support:** Choose from `BLoC`, `Riverpod`, `GetX`, or `Provider` for your presentation layer.
* **Automatic Dependency Injection (DI):** Your new feature‚Äôs dependencies and imports are seamlessly registered in your `get_it` service locator file.
* **Production-Ready Templates:** Includes robust error handling, clear comments, and easy customization.

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install Arch Wizard globally via Dart's pub tool to use it anywhere:

```bash
dart pub global activate arch_wizard
```

Ensure your PATH includes pub global executables, so the command `arch_wizard` is recognized.

---

## üõ† Usage

### Step 1: Run the Feature Creation Command

From the root of your Flutter project, run:

```bash
arch_wizard create_feature --name <feature_name> --state <state_management>
```

Replace `<feature_name>` with your desired feature name (e.g., `login`).
Choose your preferred state management from `bloc`, `riverpod`, `getx`, or `provider`.

---

### Step 2: Example Commands

```bash
# Generate a Login feature using BLoC
arch_wizard create_feature --name login --state bloc

# Generate a Product feature using Riverpod
arch_wizard create_feature --name product --state riverpod

# Generate a Profile feature using GetX
arch_wizard create_feature --name profile --state getx

# Generate a Cart feature using Provider
arch_wizard create_feature --name cart --state provider
```

---

### Step 3: What Happens?

* Creates the full directory structure inside:
  `lib/features/<feature_name>/`
* Generates domain, data, and presentation files with appropriate templates.
* Automatically updates your DI file (e.g., `lib/injection_container.dart`) with new imports and registrations.

## üí° Tips for Customization

* Generated templates include clear comments and `TODO`s to guide you customizing API calls, UI, and business logic.
* Supports multi-layer clean architecture, so you can replace or extend any layer independently.
* Easily integrate with your existing codebase by following the generated file and folder structure.
